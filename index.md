<hr />

This course provides a graduate-level introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP). We will begin with foundational concepts such as word representations, and moving through neural approaches like recurrent networks and attention mechanisms. From there, we explore modern Transformer-based architectures and conclude with recent advances in the field, such as retrieval-augmented models, mixture-of-experts, AI agents, and more.


**Prerequisites**: CS 288 assumes prior experience in machine learning and proficiency in PyTorch. Students should be familiar with neural networks, PyTorch, and NumPy; no introductory tutorials will be provided.

## Schedule (Tentative)
All deadlines are at 5:59 PM PST.
