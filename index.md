<hr />

This course provides a graduate-level introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP), covering techniques from foundational methods to modern approaches. We begin with core concepts such as word representations and neural network–based NLP models, including recurrent networks and attention mechanisms. We then study modern Transformer-based models, focusing on pre-training, fine-tuning, prompting, scaling laws, and post-training. The course concludes with recent advances in NLP, including retrieval-augmented models, reasoning models, and multimodal systems involving vision and speech.

**Prerequisites**: CS 288 assumes prior experience in machine learning and proficiency in PyTorch. Students should be familiar with neural networks, PyTorch, and NumPy; no introductory tutorials will be provided.

## Schedule (Tentative)
All deadlines are at 5:59 PM PST.
